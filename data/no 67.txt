The comic humorously depicts how someone who vehemently hated puns as a child has ironically grown up to love them as an adult, showing how our tastes and sense of humor can completely reverse over time. The humor comes from the character's transformation from angrily rejecting their parent's egg pun to enthusiastically making fruit puns themselves years later.
