The comic humorously contrasts the complexity of traditional statistical learning (requiring deep mathematical understanding and careful parameter tuning) with the seemingly simplistic approach of modern neural networks, where the solution to problems is often just "add more layers." It pokes fun at how deep learning practitioners can sometimes achieve better results with a brute-force approach than statisticians with their sophisticated theoretical frameworks.
