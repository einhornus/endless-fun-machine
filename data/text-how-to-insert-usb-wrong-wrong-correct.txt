A comic about the frustrating experience of inserting USB drives, where it humorously shows that both obvious orientations are "Wrong" while the third attempt (which is identical to the first) is somehow "Correct" - perfectly capturing the mysterious "USB superposition" phenomenon that seems to require three attempts to plug in a device with only two possible orientations.
